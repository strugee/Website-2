## Layouts
These files are used as templates for the various layouts that have been configured with the Advance Custom Fields plugin's fluid layout extension. As such, they heavily rely on the settings used for that plugin within WordPress.

If the settings for the ACF plugin are ever modified or a new layout is added, these files should be updated or a new layout file should be created as necessary.
