## Semesterly Post Types
These are custom post types which are archived according to the semester they were posted in.

The individual post types should be registered and set up in their own file within the types subdirectory. They may be a bit tricky to set up because a few custom filters will need to be registered with WordPress, so it's best to read the documentation in `common.php` and look at the existing post types when creating a new post type.

`utilities.php` is worth a look, as it contains functions which may be useful in semesterly post type templates.
