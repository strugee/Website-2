<h1>SSH to Roundtable</h1>

<p>Embedded within these pages is a Java applet that will allow you to connect
to Roundtable sercurely. Not all implementations of Java on all browsers
will be able to properly run the applet.  Due to the fact that the applet
is approximately 700K, it may take time to download, depending on your
connection speed. Also note that not all implementations of Java are able
to run this applet.</p>
<p>Man, they keep switching the resolutions and the JVMs around, some Rush Rhees are now 1024...</p>
