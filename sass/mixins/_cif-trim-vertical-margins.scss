/**
 * Trims the top and bottom margins of the element's first and last child (respectively) to be 0 lines tall.

 * This is useful for container elements which may not collapse margins with their children.
 * In such cases, the top margin of the first child element creates "padding" at the top of the container,
 * along with the bottom margin of the last child, which can create excessive whitespace and cause
 * background colors to be applied unevenly.
