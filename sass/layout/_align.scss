/**
 * Defines classes for aligning blocks of content.
 *
 * These classes set the float property on the element,
 * so they should be used with care. A common pitfall is
 * that a container will collapse to have a height of 0 if
 * all of its children are floated. The solution for this
 * is to apply a clearfix to the parent.
 *
 * However, there is no markup class for applying a clearfix
 * to discourage excessive use of these alignment classes.
 * If you need finer control over the layout, consider
 * creating a new class in the sass/modules directory
 * with the layout you need. The more generalized your module is,
 * the more reusable it will be throughout the design.
 *
 *
 * Presentational markup provided by this file:
 *
 * .align-left,.alignleft: Aligns a block of content left.
 *
 * .align-right,.alignright: Aligns a block of content right.
