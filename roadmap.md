## CIF Website Roadmap
- Get web++ up
- Remove unnecessary files from repo, move /wp-theme to /wp-content/themes/cif/
  - Cease local development, beging exclusively using web++ for development- Use MacPorts to install latest versions of Apache, PHP, and MySQL, symlinking appropriately so the server will use the latest versions by default
